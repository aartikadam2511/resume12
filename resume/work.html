                Designing a new portfolio is easy. Committing your<br> time and following through with that original<br> concept, that's the tricky part.

        <div>
            <p class="c8">I first started working on a new draft of my portfolio in 2011. I haven't been<br> working on this update for two years, but I have been coming back to it ever few<br> months. It's undergone countless iterations.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="c9">Why has it taken so long? I've been afraid to commit to any one idea. It seemed like <br>when I would decide upon a certain direction, the web would up and change its<br> game (think responsive design). This was more down to me taking my sweet time<br> more than anything else.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="c10">Not that I'm complaining. It practically became a hobby of mine to tinker with a<br> new portfolio. In a way I'm a little sad that the sketching / prototyping / designing /<br> coding elements of the portfolio are ultimately finished, but I'm excited to add some<br> flourishes in the coming weeks and months (I've been toying with snap svg which <br>I'm looking forward to integrating).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="c11">In the next few weeks I'm also going to write about the decisions I made while<br> building out this site - inspiration, evolution, content management, execution.<br> Hopefully it may be of some use to those starting out with building their first <br>portfolio - maybe help shave a year or two off it here and there!</p>
